# Projectile Simulator
Simulates the movement of an object based on: 
- Gravitational field strength
- Initial height of the object
- Initial velocity of the object

The model is limited to 2 dimensions and assumes no air resistance or any collisions, except with the ground. Using matplotlib, a graph showing the height of the object as its horizontal distance varies is displayed.

The graph can handle multiple objects to compare movement as an input is changed.
